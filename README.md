# web-framework

**Application description:**

A super-simple web framework which is a simplified version of such frameworks as "Marionette" or "Backbone.js". It includes:
- event handlers
- interruction with the server (emulated by axios)
- rendering of a single model as well as collection of models
Also, to show the work of the framework on practice, a simple "User edit" form was built.

**Objective:**
Another practice for composition vs inheritance, generics, rendering the nested elements as a tree, interruction with the server

**Stack:**
- Typescript
- axios
- parcel
